Welcome to my Github!

It's still a work in progress. I figured that rather than just saving files on my computer,
I would get into the habit of uploading class work, personal projects, and the like to github to get into the habit.

In this repository, You will find Classworks, Homework submissions, and general scratch work that I 
use to learn C++
